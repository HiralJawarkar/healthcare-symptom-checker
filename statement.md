# Problem Statement
Many people find it challenging to identify their health issues based on symptoms alone, especially without easy access to a healthcare professional. This project aims to provide a simple tool that helps users get a preliminary idea of possible illnesses by entering their symptoms.

# Scope of the Project
The project focuses on diagnosing common diseases by asking users about their symptoms and providing basic health advice. It does not replace professional medical diagnosis but serves as a helpful first step. The tool is built using Prolog to illustrate logical reasoning in healthcare.

# Target Users
This tool is designed for individuals seeking quick symptom analysis at home, students and beginners learning about AI and Prolog, and educators looking for practical examples of expert systems in healthcare.

# High-Level Features
1. Interactive symptom input via guided questions
2. Logical matching of symptoms to possible diseases using Prolog rules
3. Basic health advice and recommendations based on diagnosis
4. Simple, text-based user interface supporting easy use
