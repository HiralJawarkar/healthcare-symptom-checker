# healthcare-symptom-checker
This project is a simple symptom checker built with Prolog. It asks for a patient’s symptoms and tries to match them with common illnesses using logical rules. The system then gives basic advice or recommendations based on the possible diagnosis. It’s a basic tool that shows how Prolog can be used for healthcare decision-making.
