# healthcare-symptom-checker
This project is a simple symptom checker built with Prolog. It asks for a patient’s symptoms and tries to match them with common illnesses using logical rules. The system then gives basic advice or recommendations based on the possible diagnosis. It’s a basic tool that shows how Prolog can be used for healthcare decision-making.

# Features
- Interactive system based diagnosis
- uses logical rules in Prolog for reasoning
- Provides medical advice for common conditions

# Tools Used
- Prolog (SWISH online compiler)
- GitHub for code repository

# Steps to Install & Run the project
- clone or download the source code from the repository.
- open the '.pl' code file in SWISH prolog or paste into SWISH online complier
- Run the query 'start_diagnosis.' and follow the given prompts
